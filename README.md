# Circle-Language
Circle Language is an alternative way of writing English words using the aid of a circle stencil. It's possible to do by hand, but a lot more difficult, which is why I wrote the code in Processing and VB.

In the next few hours, I'll upload some pictures as well as a Word file that should give you the gist of how it works.

The project is partially completed, but there is one part I'm struggling with, so if anyone has any experience with Processing, please feel free to offer your support. Please.
