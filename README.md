# Circle-Language
Circle Language is an alternative way of writing English words using the aid of a circle stencil. I've attached some images if you'd like to see what it looks like.

It's possible to do by hand, but a lot more difficult, which is why I wrote the code in Processing and VB.

It's very simple to write on the main part. I've constructed it so that you need no knowledge of coding to write it. I've done all the hard work for you.

Open the Word file title 'Circle Language.docx' and you can get started.
